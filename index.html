  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Veonixe respects your privacy. This policy explains what information is collected by our app, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1. Advertising and Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    The app uses third-party advertising services such as <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. 
    These services may collect non-personal device data such as your device model, operating system, IP address, and advertising ID. 
    This data is used to deliver relevant ads and measure ad performance.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2. Image Access and Processing</h3>
  <p>
    The app may request access to your device's storage to select and process images. 
    Images are transmitted securely to external servers and APIs solely for the purpose of performing the requested AI-based processing or enhancements.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3. Device and Usage Data</h3>
  <p>
    The app may collect anonymous information about app performance, crash logs, and basic interaction data to help us improve functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve the app’s image processing features.</li>
    <li>To show personalized or contextual advertisements.</li>
    <li>To monitor and analyze usage for better performance and user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. 
    Data may be shared only with trusted third-party services (such as advertising and image-processing APIs) required for the app’s core functionality. 
    These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use secure connections (HTTPS) and encryption where applicable to protect transmitted data. 
    However, no online service can guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can withdraw storage permission at any time through your device settings. 
    If you have questions about data handling, you can contact us via

  <p>
    Veonixe does not knowingly collect or process data from children under 13 years of age. 
    If you believe a child has provided us with data, please contact us immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. 
    Any changes will be posted within the app or on this page, along with a revised “Last updated” date.
